# My-Object-Oriented-Programming-template-interpolation
I performed a template interpolation by combining elements of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  and loop concepts to generate a possible  script.  I made use of Samsung series I took the static text from OOP and loop, and interpolated them together.

#How it work 
I designed a "smart containers" (called objects) for each specific Samsung phone model (like S24 Ultra, S23 Pro, etc.). Each object holds all the details (RAM, camera, display) for that specific phone and knows how to describe itself. This setup is efficient because newer models (child objects) can automatically inherit common features from a general "Galaxy S" blueprint (parent object) while still having their own unique traits.

Loops for Display & Interaction: i store all these individual phone objects in a central list or dictionary. my script then uses loops to either:

Go through every single phone object in your catalog, one by one, and print its introduction (when you choose "show all").
Or, it waits for you to type a specific phone model name, finds that particular phone object in your catalog, and then asks that object to display all its detailed characteristics.
So, in essence, you've created a well-organized system where data about each phone is self-contained and easily retrievable, allowing you to dynamically display phone specifications based on user input.
